# FreeCodeCamp - Survey Form Challenge

This is a solution to the Responsive Web Design challenge from freecodecamp, creating a survey form using pure HTML and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Mastering HTML form is quite challenging, but it's totally worth it. Learning how to structure HTML Form element properly, styling the form beautifully, and make the validation as secure as possible.

This is one more step for me to master the frontend web developer.
